# Project 1, Timothy Herger
- An application that takes in Credit/Debit Card Transactions, 
and puts them in a Cassandra Database, and then classifies them as
of a certain type, e.g. Food & Drink for Restaurants, Groceries for Supermarkets, 
Travel for Plane Tickets, Automotive for Car Repair Shops/Dealers, etc. 
## Technical Requirements 
- Java
    - Maven
    - JUnit
    - Cassandra
    - Logback SLF4J
    - Spring Framework
    - AWS
## Features
 - Like an app on your phone, it will classify transactions as of a certain type
 - It will show how much has been spent in each category for the month (e.g., Food & Drink, Automotive, Home, etc.)
 - It will ALSO allow you to make a budget based on those categories that you are spending on. 
 - etc. (TBD)
